# Linux Instructions

The installation script requires `curl` to be installed, and some Linux distributions ship without it. You can install curl by first running the following lines in the terminal:

#### Ubuntu / Debian / Debian based distributions

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install curl
curl --version
```

#### Red-hat / Fedora / CentOS / Other Red-hat based distributions

```
yum install curl
```

After installing curl, proceed with the setup directions as normal in "Setup".
