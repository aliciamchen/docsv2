ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you've finished building your first experiment with Empirica! Now you need to deploy it to a server, so that you can send participants to it.&#x20;

There are a number of ways to do this, including setting up your own servers on Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean, or a similar platform. Check out the deployment documentation here:
