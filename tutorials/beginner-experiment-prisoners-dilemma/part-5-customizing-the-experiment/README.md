# Part 5: Customizing the experiment

So far, we've implemented a live, single-round Prisoner's Dilemma between two players. Now, we'll add customizations that allow us to explore the effects of different interventions on participants' behavior. After all - to run an experiment, you need a comparison.&#x20;

First, we'll explore the effect of varying the number of rounds of the game participants play together. Then we'll explore the effect of allowing participants to communicate via text chat.

We'll parameterize both of these interventions as different "factors" in the treatment definition, and we'll talk about how Empirica helps us randomize players between conditions to explore a causal effect.
